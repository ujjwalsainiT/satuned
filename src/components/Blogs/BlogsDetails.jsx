                        Brabus- the perfect combination of brutal power and elegant optical tuning. The worldâ€™s largest tuning
                        house for the 3-pointed premium star company, Mercedes, has come a long way from creating luxury sedans
                        including one of the fastest Limousines in the world, to creating beasts like the Invicto. Although
                        expensive, Brabus makes it a point to please its customers with its commendable work. Especially with
                        the brilliant cosmetic modifications like low profile spoilers, bodykits, carbon fiber splitters
                        multi-piece alloy wheels and other mad upgrades like racing LSDs,
                        twelve-piston disc brakes and engine remapping it is almost impossible to beat Brabus at what it does.

                        As we all know that the Mercedes GLS63 AMG is a looker from every angle, we at Sushila Autotechnik had the
                        privilege of customizing this behemoth SUV by adding a Brabus Style Body Kit.
